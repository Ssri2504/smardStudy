Prototype Brief: SmartStudy Web Application
SmartStudy is a web application designed to foster collaborative learning among students. The app allows students to host and join group study sessions via video conferencing, making it easy to connect and work together in real-time. These study sessions include useful tools such as screen sharing and text chat to enhance the collaborative experience. Students can also schedule future study sessions and receive reminders, ensuring they stay organized and committed to their study plans.

To help students manage their study tasks, SmartStudy features a to-do list function. This allows students to create, edit, and delete tasks, mark them as completed, and track their progress with visual indicators. Additionally, tasks can be assigned to group members, and notifications help keep everyone on track and informed about their responsibilities.

The application also includes a resource section where students can upload, download, and comment on various study materials. This central repository is organized by categories and tags, making it easy to find and share notes, documents, and links to external resources. By providing a dedicated space for resource sharing, SmartStudy ensures that all necessary materials are readily available and easily accessible.

The user experience is designed to be intuitive and efficient. The SmartStudy dashboard provides an overview of upcoming study sessions, to-do lists, and recently added resources, with quick links for easy access. The video study session interface is clean and straightforward, while the to-do list and resource sections are user-friendly, allowing students to focus on their studies without unnecessary distractions.

SmartStudy aims to create a supportive and organized environment for students to collaborate, manage their tasks, and access essential learning resources, ultimately enhancing their overall study experience.
